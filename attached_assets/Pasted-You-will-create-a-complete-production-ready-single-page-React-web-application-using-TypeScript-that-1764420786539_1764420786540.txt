# AI INTEGRATION



**API Configuration:**

Endpoint: https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages

Model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514

Use provided API key in header: `x-api-key: {{API_KEY}}`

Header: `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`

Header: `Content-Type: application/json`



**Review Quiz Generation Prompt:**

```

Generate exactly 5 multiple-choice questions based on this lecture content: [INSERT LECTURE CONTENT]. Return ONLY valid JSON in this format: [{"question": "string", "options": ["string", "string", "string", "string"], "correct": number (0-3), "explanation": "string"}]. DO NOT include any text outside the JSON array. Make questions test understanding, not just memorization.

```



**Daily Quiz Generation Prompt:**

```

Generate 3-5 targeted multiple-choice questions focusing on these weak areas: [INSERT WEAK TOPICS]. Student previously scored [INSERT SCORE] and has confidence level [INSERT RATING]/5. Return ONLY valid JSON in this format: [{"question": "string", "options": ["string", "string", "string", "string"], "correct": number (0-3), "explanation": "string"}]. DO NOT include any text outside the JSON array. Make questions progressively challenging and use different styles (application, analysis, synthesis).

```



**Critical JSON Parsing:**

Strip markdown code blocks from API response before parsing:

```typescript

const cleanedResponse = responseText.replace(/```json\n?/g, "").replace(/```\n?/g, "").trim();

const questions = JSON.parse(cleanedResponse);

```



**Error Handling:**

Wrap API calls in try-catch blocks

Show encouraging error messages: "Oops! Let's try that again. Your streak is safe!"

Provide retry button

Log errors to console for debugging

Handle rate limits gracefully

Validate JSON structure before using



# WEAKNESS IDENTIFICATION



**Algorithm:**

Extract key topics from incorrect answer questions

Look for capitalized terms, technical keywords, or quoted concepts

Store as array of strings

Display as colorful tags with progress indicators

Track improvement over time per topic

Mark topic as "mastered" after scoring 80%+ twice



# XP CALCULATION FUNCTION



Create a pure function:

```typescript

function calculateXP(

  correctAnswers: number,

  totalQuestions: number,

  isPerfect: boolean,

  confidenceRating: number,

  isImprovement: boolean,

  currentStreak: number

): number {

  let xp = 50; // base

  xp += correctAnswers * 10; // per correct

  if (isPerfect) xp += 50; // perfect bonus

  xp += confidenceRating * 5; // confidence bonus

  if (isImprovement) xp += 20; // improvement bonus

  xp += currentStreak * 5; // streak bonus

  

  // Apply streak multiplier

  if (currentStreak >= 30) xp *= 2;

  else if (currentStreak >= 7) xp *= 1.5;

  

  return Math.floor(xp);

}

```



# ACHIEVEMENT CHECKING



After every action that could unlock achievements, run:

```typescript

function checkAchievements(userProfile: UserProfile, lectureHistory: Lecture[]): Achievement[] {

  // Check all achievement conditions

  // Return array of newly unlocked achievements

  // Update userProfile.achievements

}

```



Check conditions for all 11 achievements listed earlier.



# DEMO MODE



Include "Try Demo" button on dashboard that pre-loads:

Sample lecture content: "Introduction to Data Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues"

User profile at Level 4 with 850 XP

3-day streak active

2 achievements unlocked: "First Steps" and "Quick Learner"

Some weak topics: ["Linked Lists", "Queue Operations"]

2 completed lectures in history

Average confidence: 3.5



This allows judges to immediately test the full workflow without uploading files.
