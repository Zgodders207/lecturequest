# CBC Hackathon

**Transforming University Learning**  
*From Passive to Personalised*

---

## The Challenge

How might we use AI to transform university learning into personalised, accessible experiences that help students both **master their subject** AND **recognise the transferable skills** they're developing for future careers?

---

## Why This Matters

### Key Statistics

- **42%** - of young people cite lack of skills as biggest employment barrier
- **5.5%** - North East unemployment vs 4.3% UK average
- **31-34%** - of graduates are overqualified for their jobs
- **40%** - feel confident they understand what employers want

---

## Remember

- ✓ Simple solutions can beat complex ones - judges care about impact
- ✓ No-code is completely valid - Claude.ai chat interface alone can win
- ✓ Prompt engineering = programming - smart prompts valued as much as code
- ✓ Accessibility matters - think about diverse student needs from the start
- ✓ Focus on ONE problem - solve it well rather than building everything
